# DQN Agent for Warehouse Storage Optimization (OpenAI Gym)

1. **Project Overview:** 
	- This project implements a Deep Q-Network (DQN) to solve a simulated warehouse environment using PyTorch and TensorBoard for training visualization.
	- The objective of the algorithm is to optimize the usage of storage shelf space in the simulated warehouse environment.
	  

2. **Features:**
	
	- TensorBoard logging (reward mean, episode length mean, exploration rate, frames per second)
	- Model saving/loading for inference 

3. **Model Performance Graphs (TensorBoard):**
